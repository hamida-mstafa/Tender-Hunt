           <p>Tender hunt  is an online tenders publishing website majoring  in ensuring suppliers get to view all tenders before their due date is reached, and also customers get to ask for the goods and services they require in time.</p>
           <p>Tender hunt  was started with 3 main aims;</p>
           <ul>
             <li>As a platform for anyone around the region to view daily tenders .</li>
             <li>To help businesses receive information concerning tenders in due time.</li>
             <li>A platform where businesses can view past advertised tenders as well as to get the tender documents.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>We post tenders from private businesses, publicly listed companies, Non Governmental Organizations (NGO), Institutions, Parastatals and the County Governments . We source tenders from every available media as well as receiving tenders directly from clients. we have also invested  in finding as many additional sources of information as possible, particularly relating to the smaller contracts which are generally much easier for a small or medium sized company to win.</p>
